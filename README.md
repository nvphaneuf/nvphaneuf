**Who Am I?**

I'm a junior at Arizona State University, relentlessly pursuing my Bachelor's in Biological Science with a cheeky minor in Data Science. 🎓 Armed with a microscope in one hand and a laptop in the other, I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between the intricacies of life sciences and the magic of data wizardry.

**What Fires Me Up?**

The intersection of AI, machine learning, and healthcare – it's like watching fireworks on New Year's Eve! I'm utterly passionate about the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning to revolutionize healthcare as we know it. From diagnosing diseases to optimizing treatment plans, I believe the future of medicine is intricately entwined with lines of code and mountains of data.

**Tools of the Trade**

Python 🐍, SQL 📊, R 📈, Tableau 🎨 – these are my trusty sidekicks in the quest for data-driven greatness. From wrangling messy datasets to crafting mesmerizing visualizations, I wield these tools with the finesse of a seasoned magician (minus the top hat, of course).
- 👀 I’m interested in healthcare data analytics and process improvement
